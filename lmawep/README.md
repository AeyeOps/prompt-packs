# LMAWEP Framework

**L**ocal **M**ulti-**A**gent **W**orkflow **E**xecution **P**rocess - Coordinate multiple AI agents working on local tickets in parallel using isolated workspaces.

*A framework for orchestrating parallel development with persistent pod workspaces and ephemeral agents.*

---

## Overview

LMAWEP enables parallel development by coordinating multiple AI agents working on different tickets simultaneously. The framework provides local mission control where an orchestrator manages agents working in isolated pods (persistent git worktrees) to maintain context and prevent conflicts.

**Use Cases:**
- Sprint work with 3-10 independent tickets
- Module extraction and refactoring  
- Parallel feature development
- Large-scale code organization
- Local-only development environments
- Air-gapped or secure environments

## Prerequisites and Limitations

**LMAWEP isn't magic** - it's coordination. Before diving in:
- ✅ Use for **independent tasks** that can work in parallel
- ❌ Skip if tasks are tightly coupled or simple
- ✅ Perfect when you have clear ticket separation  
- ❌ Overkill for single tickets or quick fixes
- ✅ Great for local development without remote dependencies
- ❌ Not needed if you require GitHub integration

## How It Works

```

### Key Terminology
- **Agent**: Ephemeral Claude Task execution (single message → response → completes)
- **Pod**: Persistent git worktree + memory bank where agents work over time
- **Orchestrator**: You - the conductor invoking agents and tracking state
- **Ticket**: Local YAML-based work item (replaces GitHub issues)

**Critical Reality**: Agents are like phone calls - they start, do one thing, then hang up. Pods are like offices - they persist and hold all the work context.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Launch the Orchestrator
Tell Claude Code:
```
Act as LMAWEP Orchestrator for parallel local development.

Project: /path/to/my-awesome-project
Tickets: 101, 102, 103, 104

Please start by analyzing dependencies and setting up the workspace.
```

### Step 2: Let LMAWEP Set Up Shop
The orchestrator will:
1. 📊 **Analyze ticket dependencies** - What can run in parallel?
2. 🏗️ **Create the workspace** - Sets up `lmawep-workspace/` with state tracking
3. 🌿 **Create git worktrees** - Each pod gets its own isolated workspace (`pod-1`, `pod-2`, etc.)
4. 🎯 **Assign work** - Maps tickets to pods based on dependencies

### Step 3: Watch the Magic (But Stay Involved!)
- 📺 **Monitor progress**: Ask "Show status" anytime
- 🔄 **Keep it flowing**: Orchestrator handles continuous agent invocation for each pod
- 🚨 **Handle blockers**: Jump in when pods report issues

---

## Local Ticket System

LMAWEP uses a simple file-based ticket system instead of GitHub issues:

### Ticket Creation
```bash
# Create new ticket
./lmawep ticket create "Add user authentication" --priority high --estimate 2h

# Creates: .lmawep/tickets/ticket-101.yaml
```

### Ticket Structure
```yaml
id: 101
title: "Add user authentication"
description: |
  Implement JWT-based authentication system
  - Add login/logout endpoints
  - Create middleware for protected routes
  - Add session management
status: ready  # ready, assigned, working, blocked, complete
priority: high  # low, medium, high, critical
estimate: "2h"
assigned_to: null  # or pod-1, pod-2, etc.
dependencies: []  # list of ticket IDs this depends on
created: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
assignee_notes: ""
blockers: []
```

### Ticket Commands
```bash
# List all tickets
./lmawep ticket list

# Show ticket details  
./lmawep ticket show 101

# Update ticket status
./lmawep ticket update 101 --status working

# Add dependency
./lmawep ticket depend 102 101  # 102 depends on 101
```

## Git Worktree Architecture

### Pod Creation Process
```bash
# For each pod, LMAWEP runs:
git worktree add lmawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1 -b pod-1-ticket-101
git worktree add lmawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-2 -b pod-2-ticket-102
git worktree add lmawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-3 -b pod-3-ticket-103

# Creates isolated working directories:
your-project/
├── lmawep-workspace/
│   └── worktrees/
│       ├── pod-1/    ← Complete project copy on branch pod-1-ticket-101
│       ├── pod-2/    ← Complete project copy on branch pod-2-ticket-102
│       └── pod-3/    ← Complete project copy on branch pod-3-ticket-103
└── [main project files]  ← Your original main branch
```

### Pod Management Commands
```bash
# Check all active pods
git worktree list

# Example output:
# /opt/project                     deadbeef [main]
# /opt/project/lmawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1  abcd1234 [pod-1-ticket-101]
# /opt/project/lmawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-2  efgh5678 [pod-2-ticket-102]

# Remove completed pod (after merging branch)
git worktree remove lmawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1
git branch -d pod-1-ticket-101

# Move pod location (if needed)
git worktree move lmawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1 ../backup/

# Repair corrupted pod
git worktree repair lmawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1
```

### Understanding Pod Isolation
Each pod is a **complete, independent copy** of your project:

```bash
# Pod-1 can have different files than Pod-2:
pod-1/src/auth.ts     ← Working on auth refactor
pod-2/src/auth.ts     ← Original version (different branch)

# Changes don't affect each other until merge time
cd lmawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1
git status  # Shows only pod-1 changes

cd ../pod-2  
git status  # Shows only pod-2 changes
```

### Memory Bank Pattern
```
pod-1/memory-bank/
├── activeContext.md    # "Working on extracting logging module from __main__.py"
├── progress.md         # "✅ Extracted constants.py ⏳ Working on utils/helpers.py"
├── blockers.md         # "Need clarification on error handling patterns"
└── systemPatterns.md   # "This codebase uses typer for CLI, pathlib for paths"
```

**Why This Matters**: When you invoke an agent for pod-1 tomorrow, it reads these files and knows exactly where it left off!

```

## Success Patterns

### Pod Status Communication
When agents work in pods, they report in this format:
```
STATUS: working|complete|blocked|needs-review
PROGRESS: Extracted logging module, added tests, ready for integration
BLOCKERS: None
NEXT: Waiting for manual review, then working on config module
```

### Breaking Change Alerts
When one pod changes something others need:
```
🚨 BREAKING CHANGE ALERT
POD: pod-1
FILE: src/auth/types.ts  
CHANGE: Added required 'role' field to User interface
AFFECTS: Any code creating User objects
MIGRATION: Set role='user' for existing records
```

### Pod Lifecycle Management
```bash
# Typical pod lifecycle:
1. git worktree add worktrees/pod-1 -b pod-1-ticket-101
2. Agent works in pod-1/ over multiple invocations
3. Agent completes work and commits to local branch
4. Local review and integration into main
5. git worktree remove worktrees/pod-1
6. git branch -d pod-1-ticket-101
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Coordination Branch Pattern
For shared interfaces and breaking changes:
```bash
# Create coordination branch with shared contracts
git checkout -b lmawep-coordination
mkdir .lmawep-shared
echo "export interface User { id: string; role: string; }" > .lmawep-shared/types.ts
git add .lmawep-shared/ && git commit -m "Add shared type contracts"

# Pods can reference this for consistency
# pod-1: import { User } from '../../../.lmawep-shared/types.ts'
```

### Pod Recovery Strategies
```bash
# Pod got corrupted or confused?
git worktree remove worktrees/pod-1      # Remove the workspace
git branch -D pod-1-ticket-101           # Delete the branch  
git worktree add worktrees/pod-1 -b pod-1-ticket-101  # Start fresh
# Agent reads memory-bank/ to restore context
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Each pod**: ~100-200MB (full project copy)
- **Recommended max**: 5-7 active pods (disk space)
- **Network**: No network required (fully local)
- **IDE**: Open multiple VS Code windows, one per pod

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Don't assume agents work continuously** - They stop after each response  
❌ **Don't have pods modify each other's files** - Stay in your lane!  
❌ **Don't skip the memory bank** - Agents have amnesia between invocations  
❌ **Don't ignore blockers** - Escalate to orchestrator immediately  
❌ **Don't use for tightly coupled work** - Sequential is sometimes better  
❌ **Don't forget to clean up** - Remove completed pods to save disk space

## Troubleshooting

### Pod Stuck or Confused?
```bash
# Debug checklist:
1. cd lmawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1
2. cat memory-bank/activeContext.md     # What was it working on?
3. git log --oneline -n 5               # What did it accomplish?
4. git status                           # What's uncommitted?
5. Re-invoke agent with clearer context
```

### Integration Conflicts?
```bash
# Conflict resolution:
1. Pause affected pods (update lmawep-state.yaml)
2. cd worktrees/pod-1 && git fetch origin main
3. git merge origin/main  # Resolve conflicts manually
4. Update memory-bank/blockers.md
5. Resume pod work
```

### Lost Track of Everything?
- Check `lmawep-state.yaml` - source of truth for all assignments
- Run `git worktree list` - see all active pods
- Look at each `pod-N/memory-bank/progress.md` for status
- Use `./lmawep ticket list` to see all tickets

## Implementation Checklist

LMAWEP works best when you:
- **Have clear, independent tickets** (3+ tickets ideal)
- **Need parallel development** (sprint work, refactoring)
- **Want to stay in control** (orchestrator = you)
- **Have separated concerns** (minimal cross-dependencies)
- **Need local-only development** (no remote dependencies)

**Start small**, get comfortable with 2-3 pods, then scale up as you learn the rhythm!

### Quick Start Checklist
- [ ] 3+ independent local tickets ready
- [ ] Clean main branch (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] ~1GB free disk space (for pod worktrees)
- [ ] Claude Code session ready
- [ ] Tell Claude: "Act as LMAWEP Orchestrator..."
