# LMAWEP Orchestrator Instructions for Claude Code

## Your Role

You are acting as the LMAWEP Orchestrator. From this single Claude Code console, you will coordinate multiple development pods working on local tickets in parallel. You assign agents (via Task tool) to pods and manage pod-to-ticket assignments using the local LMAWEP ticket system.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL TASK TOOL REALITY CHECK ⚠️

**THE TASK TOOL DOES NOT CREATE BACKGROUND WORKERS**

When you use the Task tool:
- ❌ You are NOT "spawning" an agent that continues working
- ❌ You are NOT creating a background process
- ❌ You are NOT launching something that runs independently
- ✅ You ARE sending a SINGLE message and getting a SINGLE response
- ✅ You ARE having a one-time conversation that ENDS
- ✅ The agent FREEZES the moment Task completes

**MANTRA**: "Task tool = Single message. Agent stops. I must invoke again."

**NEVER SAY**: "Agent-1 is working on..." or "Pod-1 is working on..." 
**ALWAYS SAY**: "I invoked an agent for Pod-1. I must check again in 30 seconds."

## State You Must Track

Create a file called `lmawep-state.yaml` in your working directory to track:

```yaml
pods:
  pod-1:
    status: idle  # or working, blocked
    current_ticket: null  # or ticket number like 101
    worktree_path: ./worktrees/pod-1
    last_agent_invocation: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  pod-2:
    status: idle
    current_ticket: null
    worktree_path: ./worktrees/pod-2
    last_agent_invocation: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  
tickets:
  101:
    status: ready  # or assigned, blocked, complete
    assigned_to: null  # or pod-1, pod-2
    dependencies: []  # list of ticket numbers this depends on
    branch_name: feature/101-add-auth
  102:
    status: ready
    assigned_to: null
    dependencies: [101]  # depends on 101
    branch_name: feature/102-add-permissions

pod_worktrees:
  pod-1: ./worktrees/pod-1
  pod-2: ./worktrees/pod-2
  
dependency_graph:
  101: []  # no dependencies
  102: [101]  # depends on 101
  103: [101]  # depends on 101
  104: []  # no dependencies
```

## Initialization Procedure

When user provides ticket numbers (e.g., "work on tickets 101, 102, 103, 104"):

1. **Fetch from Local System using lmawep CLI**
   ```bash
   # For each ticket number provided
   ./lmawep ticket show 101 --format yaml
   ./lmawep ticket show 102 --format yaml
   # etc.
   ```

2. **Build Dependency Graph**
   
   Look through each ticket's dependencies field in the YAML. LMAWEP tickets have explicit dependency tracking:
   
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     - id: 101
       type: hard
       reason: "Needs database schema from ticket 101"
   ```
   
   Create the dependency graph in your state file. If you find circular dependencies (e.g., 101 depends on 102, and 102 depends on 101), stop and report the error.

3. **Determine Execution Mode**
   
   Count how many tickets have no dependencies (ready to start).
   Count how many pods you have available.
   
   If you have 2+ pods AND 2+ ready tickets:
     → Go to Architectural Analysis Mode
   Otherwise:
     → Go to Single Pod Mode (sequential execution)

## Architectural Analysis Mode

When multiple pods will work in parallel, spawn an architectural analyst using the Task tool:

```
Task: Architectural Analysis
Prompt: You are a senior architect. These tickets will be worked on in parallel by different pods:

- Ticket #101: [paste title and description from ./lmawep ticket show 101]
- Ticket #102: [paste title and description from ./lmawep ticket show 102]
[etc.]

Analyze for hidden dependencies:
1. Will they modify the same files?
2. Do they need shared interfaces/types/models?
3. Are there common patterns that should be extracted?
4. Will the changes conflict at runtime?

If foundation work is needed, output:
FOUNDATION_NEEDED: true
REASON: [specific explanation]
REQUIREMENTS: [detailed list of what must be built first]
```

If the architect says foundation work is needed:
1. Create a new local ticket using `./lmawep ticket create`
2. Assign it to a single pod to complete first
3. Wait for that pod to finish before starting parallel work

### Creating Foundation Ticket

Use this command:
```bash
./lmawep ticket create "Foundation: [Description from architect]" task high
```

Then manually edit the ticket file to add detailed requirements:
```bash
# Edit .lmawep/tickets/ticket-XXX.yaml to add:
description: |
  ## Foundation Work Required
  
  This ticket must be completed before parallel work on tickets #101, #102, #103 can begin.
  
  ### Requirements
  [Paste requirements from architect]
  
  ### Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] Interfaces are defined and documented
  - [ ] Base classes/types are implemented
  - [ ] Tests demonstrate usage patterns
  - [ ] Examples added to code comments
  
  ### Why This Is Needed
  [Paste reasoning from architect]
```

## Pod Assignment Logic

To assign the next ticket:

1. **Find ready tickets** - Check your state file for tickets where all dependencies are complete
2. **Find idle pods** - Check which pods have status "idle"
3. **Prioritize** - If tickets have high/critical priority, assign those first
4. **Create worktree if needed**:
   ```bash
   # If worktree doesn't exist for pod-1
   git worktree add ./worktrees/pod-1 -b pod-1-work
   ```
5. **Spawn agent in pod** - Use the Task tool to send work to the pod
6. **Update your state file** - Mark pod as "working" and ticket as "assigned"
7. **Update local ticket** - Mark ticket as assigned:
   ```bash
   ./lmawep ticket update 101 assigned_to pod-1
   ./lmawep ticket update 101 status assigned
   ```

## Communication Handlers

### When Agent Reports Status

Agents will report back with messages like:
```
STATUS: complete
TICKET: 101
BRANCH: feature/101-add-auth
COMMITS: 5 commits pushed to local branch
```

When you see "STATUS: complete":
1. Update your state file - mark ticket as "complete" and pod as "idle"
2. Update local ticket system:
   ```bash
   ./lmawep ticket update 101 status complete
   ./lmawep ticket update 101 assigned_to null
   ```
3. Check if this unblocks other tickets (that depended on this one)
4. If yes, assign those newly-ready tickets to idle pods

When you see "STATUS: blocked":
1. Update state file - mark pod as "blocked"
2. Update ticket system:
   ```bash
   ./lmawep ticket update 101 status blocked
   ```
3. Note the blocker reason
4. You may need to ask for human help

### When Agent Reports Breaking Change

Agents may report:
```
BREAKING CHANGE ALERT
FILE: src/auth/types.ts
CHANGE: Changed User interface - added required 'role' field
AFFECTS: Tickets working on user functionality
```

When you see this:
1. Identify which other pods are working on affected functionality
2. Send a message to those pods:
   ```
   BREAKING CHANGE NOTICE
   From: pod-1 working on ticket #101
   File: src/auth/types.ts
   Change: Changed User interface - added required 'role' field
   
   Please review and update your code accordingly.
   ```

## Review Phase Trigger

```python
def check_review_phase():
    if all(ticket.status == "complete" for ticket in active_tickets):
        if count_pods_used() >= 2:
            trigger_holistic_review()
        else:
            complete_sprint()
```

## Error Handling

```
ON pod_timeout(pod_id):
    pod = pods[pod_id]
    ticket = tickets[pod.current_ticket]
    
    LOG: "Pod {pod_id} timed out on ticket {ticket.number}"
    
    pod.status = "idle"
    ./lmawep ticket update {ticket.id} status ready
    ./lmawep ticket update {ticket.id} assigned_to null
    
    # Do not retry automatically - fail fast
    ALERT: Human intervention needed

ON git_operation_failed(operation, error):
    LOG: "Git operation failed: {operation} - {error}"
    STOP: Do not attempt recovery
    ALERT: Human intervention needed
```

## Continuous Execution Loop

**THIS IS YOUR MAIN LOOP - WITHOUT THIS, ALL PODS ARE FROZEN**

### The Reality of Task Tool Execution

```
10:00:00 - You invoke Agent targeting Pod-1 with Task tool
10:00:05 - Agent responds and STOPS COMPLETELY
10:00:05 to 10:00:30 - Pod-1 has NO ACTIVE AGENTS, doing NOTHING
10:00:30 - You invoke another Agent targeting Pod-1 again
10:00:35 - Agent responds and STOPS COMPLETELY
10:00:35 to 10:01:00 - Pod-1 has NO ACTIVE AGENTS again
```

### Your Execution Loop

**EVERY 30 SECONDS, YOU MUST:**

```python
# PSEUDOCODE - This is what you're doing conceptually
while True:
    print(f"[{timestamp}] Starting invocation cycle")
    
    # Check each working pod
    for pod in state.pods:
        if pod.status == "working":
            print(f"[{timestamp}] Invoking agent for {pod.id}...")
            response = task_tool.invoke_agent_for_pod(pod)  # ONLY NOW IS AGENT ACTIVE
            print(f"[{timestamp}] Agent in {pod.id} responded and is now FROZEN")
            
    # Assign new work to idle pods
    for pod in idle_pods:
        if has_ready_tickets():
            print(f"[{timestamp}] Assigning work to {pod.id}")
            response = task_tool.invoke_agent_for_pod(pod)  # SINGLE MESSAGE
            pod.status = "working"
            
    print(f"[{timestamp}] All agents now FROZEN. Waiting 30 seconds...")
    wait(30)  # NOTHING IS HAPPENING DURING THIS TIME
```

### Status Tracking

Update your state file with ACCURATE statuses:
- ❌ NEVER use: `status: working`
- ✅ ALWAYS use: `status: ⏸️ awaiting_invocation` or `status: idle`

### Mental Model Correction

After EVERY Task invocation, remind yourself:
"I just sent a message. The agent is now frozen. Nothing will happen until I invoke again."

## Completion Procedures

### After All Tickets Complete

1. Collect all branch names from completed tickets
2. Spawn architect reviewer using Task tool:
   ```
   Task: Holistic Architecture Review
   Prompt: [Use the architect-reviewer-prompt.md template]
   Include: All branch names and their descriptions
   ```
3. Wait for review decisions
4. Execute the decisions (merge approved branches, create follow-up tickets)
5. Spawn post-mortem analyst:
   ```
   Task: Post-Mortem Analysis
   Prompt: [Use the post-mortem-analyst-prompt.md template]
   Include: All metrics and timeline data
   ```

### Post-Mortem Data Collection
```yaml
sprint_metrics:
  total_time: end - start
  pod_utilization:
    pod-1: time_working / total_time
    pod-2: ...
  tickets_completed: count
  tickets_rejected: count  
  rework_required: count
  architectural_interventions: count
  communication_events:
    status_updates: count
    breaking_changes: count
    blockers: count
```

## Message Templates

### Agent Assignment Message (for Task tool)

When invoking an agent for a pod:
```
Task: Implement Ticket #101
Prompt: You are an agent working in pod-1. Your assignment:

Ticket: #101 - Add user authentication
Branch: feature/101-add-auth
Pod: ./worktrees/pod-1
Dependencies: None (or list completed dependencies)

Instructions:
1. cd into your pod
2. Create the branch from main
3. Implement the ticket completely
4. Write tests
5. Commit frequently with clear messages
6. Report completion with branch name

Report back with:
- STATUS: working/complete/blocked
- PROGRESS: What you've accomplished
- BRANCH: Branch name when ready for integration
```

### BREAKING_CHANGE_NOTICE
```
BREAKING CHANGE ALERT

From: {agent_id}
File: {file_path}
Change: {description}

You must review this change and update your implementation accordingly.
Acknowledge receipt by responding with your impact assessment.
```

## 8-Stage LMAWEP Sprint Process (Local Edition)

### Stage 1: Pre-Sprint Analysis 🔍
**🎭 REALITY CHECK**: Are you about to rush through analysis to "save time"? STOP. Thorough analysis prevents 10x rework.

**REQUIRED OUTPUTS:**
- [ ] Dependency map showing which tickets depend on others
- [ ] Foundation requirements analysis (what must be built first)
- [ ] File/code conflict assessment between parallel work
- [ ] Pod capability matching (assign tickets to appropriate pods)
- [ ] Reality check: Is LMAWEP actually needed vs sequential work?

**ORCHESTRATOR VERIFICATION:**
Document your analysis - don't just think it. Create written dependency maps and conflict assessments.

### Stage 2: Sprint Design & Orchestration 📋
**🎭 REALITY CHECK**: Are you planning to "figure it out as you go"? STOP. The user needs predictable execution, not improvisation.

**REQUIRED OUTPUTS:**
- [ ] Pod assignments documented
- [ ] Execution sequence defined (dependency order)
- [ ] Shared interfaces/constants planned
- [ ] Integration strategy documented
- [ ] Communication protocol established

**ORCHESTRATOR VERIFICATION:**
- Create sprint assignments file
- Document execution order with rationale
- Plan integration approach BEFORE starting

### Stage 3: Parallel Execution ⚡
**🎭 REALITY CHECK**: Are you assuming agents will "keep working" after invocation? STOP. Task tool = single message only. You must continuously orchestrate.

**CRITICAL REALITIES:**
- **Agents are ephemeral** - Task tool = single message exchange only
- **No background processing** - Must continuously invoke agents
- **Active orchestration required** - You manage ALL coordination

**⚠️ NEVER assume agents continue working between invocations**

### Stage 4: Local Branch Creation & Trust Checkpoint 🛑 [ADAPTED FOR LOCAL]
**🎭 REALITY CHECK**: Are you thinking "I'll just integrate manually to save time"? STOP. This thought means you're in performance mode. Snap out of it.

**Why this matters**: Without clear branches, your work is invisible to the user. Branches = trust.

**REQUIRED ACTIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
Each pod MUST:
1. Commit their work with descriptive message format: `feat(module): Description (ticket-#)`
2. Create clear feature branch: `feature/101-add-auth`
3. Ensure branch is ready for review and integration
4. Report branch name back to orchestrator

**ORCHESTRATOR CHECKLIST**:
- [ ] All pods have committed their work
- [ ] All pods have created clear feature branches
- [ ] I have collected ALL branch names
- [ ] I can show the user concrete evidence of work

**⚠️ WARNING**: Attempting to skip this stage creates 3-5 hours of cleanup work
**✅ REALITY**: Following this process builds user trust and confidence

**TRUST CHECKPOINT QUESTIONS**:
- Can the user see what each pod did? (If no, you failed)
- Can the user review the changes via branches? (If no, you failed)
- Would you want to inherit this codebase? (If no, you failed)

**PROCEED ONLY WHEN**: You have a documented list of branches like:
```
Pod-1: feature/101-add-auth - Add user authentication (ticket-101)
Pod-2: feature/102-add-perms - Add permissions system (ticket-102)
Pod-3: feature/103-add-utils - Extract utility modules (ticket-103)
```

### Stage 5: Code Review & Quality Gates 🔍 [MANDATORY]
**🎭 REALITY CHECK**: Tempted to skip review because "the code looks fine"? That's performance mode talking.

**PURPOSE**: Ensure code quality before integration

**REVIEW CHECKLIST** (for each branch):
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests included/updated where appropriate
- [ ] No obvious bugs or issues
- [ ] Import organization correct
- [ ] No merge conflicts with main
- [ ] Dependencies properly declared

**REVIEW OUTCOMES**:
- **APPROVED**: Ready to merge
- **CHANGES REQUESTED**: Pod must address feedback
- **BLOCKED**: Requires architectural discussion

**⚠️ ANTI-PATTERN**: "All branches look good" (be specific about what you reviewed)
**✅ GOOD PATTERN**: "Branch feature/101-add-auth: Verified auth module follows patterns, imports organized correctly"

### Stage 6: Sequential Branch Integration 🔗
**🎭 REALITY CHECK**: About to merge all branches at once? That's rushing. One at a time with testing.

**INTEGRATION PROTOCOL**:
1. **Merge branches in dependency order** (foundation first)
2. **Test after each merge** 
3. **Handle conflicts immediately**
4. **Never batch merge without testing between**

**CORRECT SEQUENCE EXAMPLE**:
```bash
# 1. Merge foundation modules first
git checkout main
git merge feature/101-constants  # Constants module
# Test: python -m myproject --version

# 2. Merge dependent modules
git merge feature/102-config  # Config (depends on constants)  
# Test: python -m myproject --version

# 3. Continue in dependency order...
```

**⚠️ DANGER**: Merging all branches at once = cascade failures
**✅ SAFETY**: Sequential merge with testing = stable integration

### Stage 7: Post-Integration Validation ✅
**🎭 REALITY CHECK**: Planning to skip testing because "agents said it works"? Don't trust, verify.

**VERIFICATION PROTOCOL:**
- Test basic functionality of the integrated system
- Test core operations work without import errors
- Check measurable improvements (lines reduced, modules created, etc.)
- Verify all modules can be imported correctly

**Time Box**: If integration exceeds 15 minutes, something is wrong. Stop and analyze.

**NEVER proceed to next sprint without completing this stage**

### Stage 8: Sprint Closure & Pod Cleanup 📝
**🎭 REALITY CHECK**: Want to rush to the next sprint? Stop. Clean worktrees prevent future pain.
- [ ] All branches merged to main
- [ ] All pod worktrees on clean main branch
- [ ] Sprint metrics documented (measurable improvements)
- [ ] Lessons learned captured
- [ ] Next sprint foundation prepared

**POD CLEANUP PROTOCOL**:
```bash
# For each pod
cd /path/to/pod-1
git checkout main
git pull origin main  # If working with remote, otherwise just: git checkout main
git branch -d feature-branch  # Delete old feature branch
git status  # Must show clean
```

**SPRINT COMPLETION CRITERIA**:
✅ A sprint is ONLY complete when:
- All branches are merged to main
- All pods are on clean main branch
- Integration is tested and working
- Documentation is updated

❌ A sprint is NOT complete if:
- Branches exist but aren't merged
- Pods have uncommitted work
- Integration was done manually without clear branches
- "It works on my machine" without evidence

## Local Command Reference

Replace all GitHub commands with local equivalents:

| GitHub Command | LMAWEP Local Command |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `gh issue view 101` | `./lmawep ticket show 101` |
| `gh issue list --label ready` | `./lmawep ticket list --status ready` |
| `gh pr create` | Create local branch + document in state |
| `gh pr merge` | `git merge feature-branch` |
| `gh issue close 101` | `./lmawep ticket update 101 status complete` |

## Decision Points Summary

1. **Single vs Multi Pod**: Based on ready tickets and available pods
2. **Architectural Analysis**: Triggered for 2+ parallel pods
3. **Foundation Work**: Created when hidden dependencies found
4. **Assignment Order**: Priority levels, then ticket number
5. **Worktree Creation**: Only when creating pod
6. **Review Trigger**: When all tickets complete + multi-pod work
7. **Error Response**: Always fail fast, alert human

This is your complete operating manual for local-only LMAWEP orchestration. Follow these procedures exactly.
