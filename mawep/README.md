# MAWEP Framework üéØ

**M**ulti-**A**gent **W**orkflow **E**xecution **P**rocess - Like having a killer development crew that doesn't step on each other's code! 

*Coordinate agents working in persistent pod workspaces on GitHub issues in parallel while keeping your sanity intact.*

---

## üöÄ What's This All About?

Ever wanted to split up a big development sprint and have multiple AI agents tackle different pieces simultaneously? MAWEP makes it happen without the chaos. Think of it as **your project's mission control** - one orchestrator invokes agents who work in dedicated pods (persistent git worktrees) so they never lose context or step on each other.

**Perfect for:**
- üî• Sprint work with 3-10 independent issues
- üéØ Module extraction and refactoring
- ‚ö° Parallel feature development
- üèóÔ∏è Large-scale code organization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Reality Check First!

**MAWEP isn't magic** - it's coordination. Before diving in:
- ‚úÖ Use for **independent tasks** that can work in parallel
- ‚ùå Skip if tasks are tightly coupled or simple
- ‚úÖ Perfect when you have clear issue separation  
- ‚ùå Overkill for single issues or quick fixes

### Key Terminology (No Confusion Zone!)
- **üé≠ Agent**: Ephemeral Claude Task execution (single message ‚Üí response ‚Üí *poof* gone)
- **üè† Pod**: Persistent git worktree + memory bank where agents work over time
- **üéØ Orchestrator**: You - the conductor invoking agents and tracking state

**Critical Reality**: Agents are like phone calls - they start, do one thing, then hang up. Pods are like offices - they persist and hold all the work context.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (Your First Mission)

### Step 1: Launch the Orchestrator
Tell Claude Code:
```
Act as MAWEP Orchestrator for parallel development.

Repository: my-org/awesome-project
Issues: #101, #102, #103, #104

Please start by analyzing dependencies and setting up the workspace.
```

### Step 2: Let MAWEP Set Up Shop
The orchestrator will:
1. üìä **Analyze issue dependencies** - What can run in parallel?
2. üèóÔ∏è **Create the workspace** - Sets up `mawep-workspace/` with state tracking
3. üåø **Create git worktrees** - Each pod gets its own isolated workspace (`pod-1`, `pod-2`, etc.)
4. üéØ **Assign work** - Maps issues to pods based on dependencies

### Step 3: Watch the Magic (But Stay Involved!)
- üì∫ **Monitor progress**: Ask "Show status" anytime
- üîÑ **Keep it flowing**: Orchestrator handles continuous agent invocation for each pod
- üö® **Handle blockers**: Jump in when pods report issues

## üîß Git Worktree Deep Dive (The Technical Stuff)

Now that you know WHY, here's HOW it actually works under the hood.

### Pod Creation (What MAWEP Does Automatically)
```bash
# For each pod, MAWEP runs:
git worktree add mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1 -b pod-1-issue-101
git worktree add mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-2 -b pod-2-issue-102
git worktree add mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-3 -b pod-3-issue-103

# Creates isolated working directories:
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mawep-workspace/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worktrees/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pod-1/    ‚Üê Complete project copy on branch pod-1-issue-101
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pod-2/    ‚Üê Complete project copy on branch pod-2-issue-102
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pod-3/    ‚Üê Complete project copy on branch pod-3-issue-103
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [main project files]  ‚Üê Your original main branch
```

### Pod Management Commands (For Manual Control)
```bash
# Check all active pods
git worktree list

# Example output:
# /opt/project                     deadbeef [main]
# /opt/project/mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1  abcd1234 [pod-1-issue-101]
# /opt/project/mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-2  efgh5678 [pod-2-issue-102]

# Remove completed pod (after merging PR)
git worktree remove mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1
git branch -d pod-1-issue-101

# Move pod location (if needed)
git worktree move mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1 ../backup/

# Repair corrupted pod
git worktree repair mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1
```

### Understanding Pod Isolation
Each pod is a **complete, independent copy** of your project:

```bash
# Pod-1 can have different files than Pod-2:
pod-1/src/auth.ts     ‚Üê Working on auth refactor
pod-2/src/auth.ts     ‚Üê Original version (different branch)

# Changes don't affect each other until merge time
cd mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1
git status  # Shows only pod-1 changes

cd ../pod-2  
git status  # Shows only pod-2 changes
```

### Memory Bank Pattern (Context Persistence)
```
pod-1/memory-bank/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ activeContext.md    # "Working on extracting logging module from __main__.py"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ progress.md         # "‚úÖ Extracted constants.py ‚è≥ Working on utils/helpers.py"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blockers.md         # "Need clarification on error handling patterns"
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ systemPatterns.md   # "This codebase uses typer for CLI, pathlib for paths"
```

**Why This Matters**: When you invoke an agent for pod-1 tomorrow, it reads these files and knows exactly where it left off!

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [your regular project files] # Main branch (untouched during work)
```

## üéØ Success Patterns

### üì¢ Pod Status Communication
When agents work in pods, they report in this format:
```
STATUS: working|complete|blocked|needs-review
PROGRESS: Extracted logging module, added tests, created PR #205
BLOCKERS: None
NEXT: Waiting for PR review, then working on config module
```

### üîî Breaking Change Alerts
When one pod changes something others need:
```
üö® BREAKING CHANGE ALERT
POD: pod-1
FILE: src/auth/types.ts  
CHANGE: Added required 'role' field to User interface
AFFECTS: Any code creating User objects
MIGRATION: Set role='user' for existing records
```

### üîÑ Pod Lifecycle Management
```bash
# Typical pod lifecycle:
1. git worktree add worktrees/pod-1 -b pod-1-issue-101
2. Agent works in pod-1/ over multiple invocations
3. Agent creates PR from pod-1-issue-101 ‚Üí main
4. PR gets reviewed and merged
5. git worktree remove worktrees/pod-1
6. git branch -d pod-1-issue-101
```

## üé∏ Advanced Moves

### Coordination Branch Pattern
For shared interfaces and breaking changes:
```bash
# Create coordination branch with shared contracts
git checkout -b mawep-coordination
mkdir .mawep
echo "export interface User { id: string; role: string; }" > .mawep/types.ts
git add .mawep/ && git commit -m "Add shared type contracts"

# Pods can reference this for consistency
# pod-1: import { User } from '../../../.mawep/types.ts'
```

### Pod Recovery Strategies
```bash
# Pod got corrupted or confused?
git worktree remove worktrees/pod-1      # Remove the workspace
git branch -D pod-1-issue-101            # Delete the branch  
git worktree add worktrees/pod-1 -b pod-1-issue-101  # Start fresh
# Agent reads memory-bank/ to restore context
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Each pod**: ~100-200MB (full project copy)
- **Recommended max**: 5-7 active pods (disk space)
- **Network**: Each pod can `git push` independently
- **IDE**: Open multiple VS Code windows, one per pod

## üö´ What Not To Do (Learn from Others' Pain)

‚ùå **Don't assume agents work continuously** - They stop after each response  
‚ùå **Don't have pods modify each other's files** - Stay in your lane!  
‚ùå **Don't skip the memory bank** - Agents have amnesia between invocations  
‚ùå **Don't ignore blockers** - Escalate to orchestrator immediately  
‚ùå **Don't use for tightly coupled work** - Sequential is sometimes better  
‚ùå **Don't forget to clean up** - Remove completed pods to save disk space

## üîç When Things Go Sideways

### Pod Stuck or Confused?
```bash
# Debug checklist:
1. cd mawep-workspace/worktrees/pod-1
2. cat memory-bank/activeContext.md     # What was it working on?
3. git log --oneline -n 5               # What did it accomplish?
4. git status                           # What's uncommitted?
5. Re-invoke agent with clearer context
```

### Integration Conflicts?
```bash
# Conflict resolution:
1. Pause affected pods (update mawep-state.yaml)
2. cd worktrees/pod-1 && git fetch origin main
3. git merge origin/main  # Resolve conflicts manually
4. Update memory-bank/blockers.md
5. Resume pod work
```

### Lost Track of Everything?
- Check `mawep-state.yaml` - source of truth for all assignments
- Run `git worktree list` - see all active pods
- Look at each `pod-N/memory-bank/progress.md` for status

## üéä Ready to Rock?

MAWEP works best when you:
- üéØ **Have clear, independent issues** (3+ issues ideal)
- üèóÔ∏è **Need parallel development** (sprint work, refactoring)
- üéÆ **Want to stay in control** (orchestrator = you)
- üí™ **Have separated concerns** (minimal cross-dependencies)

**Start small**, get comfortable with 2-3 pods, then scale up as you learn the rhythm!

### Quick Start Checklist
- [ ] 3+ independent GitHub issues ready
- [ ] Clean main branch (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] ~1GB free disk space (for pod worktrees)
- [ ] Claude Code session ready
- [ ] Tell Claude: "Act as MAWEP Orchestrator..."
