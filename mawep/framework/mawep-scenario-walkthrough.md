## Timeline Execution

### T+0: Initialization Phase

```
Orchestrator: Starting MAWEP workflow for issues 101,102,103,104,105

[INFO] Creating mawep-workspace directory
[INFO] Fetching issues with gh CLI
[INFO] Building dependency graph
[INFO] Creating 5 pods for parallel work
[INFO] Dependency analysis complete:
  - Issue 101: No dependencies (can start immediately)
  - Issue 102: Depends on 101
  - Issue 103: Depends on 101  
  - Issue 104: Depends on 101
  - Issue 105: Depends on 104
```

**Orchestrator Decision**: Assign issue 101 to Pod-1 since it has no dependencies.

### T+1 minute: First Assignment

```
Orchestrator invokes agent for Pod-1 using Task tool:

Task: Implement Issue #101
Prompt: You are an agent working in pod-1. Your assignment:

Issue: #101 - Create payment gateway abstraction
Branch: feature/101-payment-gateway-abstraction
Pod: ./worktrees/pod-1

Instructions:
1. cd into your pod
2. Create the branch from main
3. Implement the issue completely
4. Report back with STATUS and PROGRESS
```

**Agent in Pod-1 Actions**:
```bash
# Navigate to pod worktree
cd ./worktrees/pod-1

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/101-payment-gateway-abstraction origin/main

# Start implementation
# Working on src/payment/gateway.py and interfaces.py
```

### T+30 minutes: Progress Update

**Orchestrator checks Pod-1 status**:
```
Task: Check Pod-1 Progress
Prompt: Report status on issue #101
```

**Agent in Pod-1 responds**:
```
STATUS: working
PROGRESS: Created abstract PaymentGateway class, defined PaymentRequest/Response interfaces
BLOCKERS: None
NEXT: Working on transaction state management and error handling
```

The agent also posts to GitHub issue #101:
```markdown
## ðŸ¤– Pod-1 Update - [2024-01-15 10:31 UTC]

### Progress
- âœ… Created abstract PaymentGateway class
- âœ… Defined PaymentRequest/Response interfaces
- ðŸ”„ Working on transaction state management

### Next Steps
- Complete error handling interfaces
- Add comprehensive docstrings
- Create unit tests

### Estimated Completion
- 40% complete
```

### T+2 hours: Breaking Change Alert

**Agent in Pod-1 reports breaking change**:
```
BREAKING CHANGE ALERT
POD: pod-1
FILE: src/payment/interfaces.py
CHANGE: Added 'idempotency_key' as required field in PaymentRequest
AFFECTS: Issues 102, 103, 104 (any code creating PaymentRequest)
MIGRATION: Generate UUID for idempotency_key in all PaymentRequest instantiations
```

**Orchestrator** receives this alert and holds off on assigning issues 102, 103, 104 until this interface stabilizes. The orchestrator updates its state file to track this dependency.

### T+4 hours: Issue 101 Complete

**Agent in Pod-1 reports completion**:
```
STATUS: complete
ISSUE: 101
PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/456
PROGRESS: Payment gateway abstraction fully implemented with 95% test coverage
```

The agent has already pushed the code:
```bash
# Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(payment): implement payment gateway abstraction (#101)

- Created abstract PaymentGateway base class
- Defined PaymentRequest/Response interfaces  
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Included transaction state management
- 95% test coverage achieved"

git push origin feature/101-payment-gateway-abstraction
```

**Orchestrator** immediately assigns:
- Issue 102 â†’ Pod-2
- Issue 103 â†’ Pod-3  
- Issue 104 â†’ Pod-4

### T+4.5 hours: Parallel Development

**Orchestrator invokes agents for three pods in parallel**:

**Pod-2** (Stripe):
```
Task: Implement Issue #102
Prompt: You are an agent working in pod-2. Implement Stripe payment provider.
Dependencies: Issue #101 is complete. Use PaymentGateway interface from pod-1.
```

**Pod-3** (PayPal):
```
Task: Implement Issue #103  
Prompt: You are an agent working in pod-3. Implement PayPal payment provider.
Dependencies: Issue #101 is complete. Use PaymentGateway interface from pod-1.
```

**Pod-4** (API):
```
Task: Implement Issue #104
Prompt: You are an agent working in pod-4. Create checkout API endpoints.
Dependencies: Issue #101 is complete. Use PaymentGateway abstraction.
```

Agents work in their respective pods:
```python
# Pod-2: src/payment/providers/stripe.py
class StripeGateway(PaymentGateway):
    def process_payment(self, request: PaymentRequest) -> PaymentResponse:
        # Implementation...

# Pod-3: src/payment/providers/paypal.py  
class PayPalGateway(PaymentGateway):
    def process_payment(self, request: PaymentRequest) -> PaymentResponse:
        # Implementation...

# Pod-4: src/api/checkout.py
@router.post("/checkout/process")
async def process_checkout(request: CheckoutRequest) -> CheckoutResponse:
    # Implementation...
```

### T+6 hours: Conflict Detection

**Orchestrator checks Pod-4 status**:
```
Task: Check Pod-4 Progress
Prompt: Report status on issue #104
```

**Agent in Pod-4 reports potential conflict**:
```
STATUS: blocked
PROGRESS: API endpoints 80% complete
BLOCKERS: Need to modify src/utils/validation.py but it may conflict with other pods
NEXT: Waiting for guidance on shared file modification
```

**Orchestrator checks state and finds Pod-2 is also working on validation**. Orchestrator invokes Pod-4 again with guidance:

```
Task: Continue with Alternative Approach
Prompt: Pod-4, instead of modifying src/utils/validation.py, create new validation 
in src/api/validators.py to avoid conflicts with Pod-2's work.
```

**Agent in Pod-4 acknowledges**:
```
Acknowledged. Creating separate validation in src/api/validators.py instead.
STATUS: working
```

### T+8 hours: Dependencies Resolved

**Orchestrator's continuous monitoring reveals completions**:

```
# Every 30 seconds, orchestrator checks all working pods
Task: Status Check Round
Prompts sent to Pod-2, Pod-3, Pod-4
```

**Pod-2 reports**:
```
STATUS: complete
ISSUE: 102
PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/457
PROGRESS: Stripe payment provider fully implemented and tested
```

**Pod-3 reports**:
```
STATUS: complete  
ISSUE: 103
PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/458
PROGRESS: PayPal payment provider fully implemented and tested
```

**Pod-4 reports**:
```
STATUS: complete
ISSUE: 104
PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/459
PROGRESS: Checkout API endpoints complete with integration tests
```

**Orchestrator** updates state file and assigns issue 105 â†’ Pod-5

### T+10 hours: Frontend Development

**Orchestrator invokes agent for Pod-5**:
```
Task: Implement Issue #105
Prompt: You are an agent working in pod-5. Implement checkout frontend components.
Dependencies: Issue #104 is complete. The checkout API is now available.
Pod: ./worktrees/pod-5
```

**Agent in Pod-5 starts frontend work**:
```typescript
// Working in pod-5/frontend/components/Checkout.tsx
import { useCheckoutAPI } from '../api/checkout';

export const Checkout: React.FC = () => {
  // Implementation with full API available
  const { processCheckout } = useCheckoutAPI();
  // Component implementation...
};
```

### T+12 hours: Final Coordination

**Orchestrator's regular status check reveals all work complete**:

```
Task: Final Status Check
Prompts sent to all pods
```

**Pod-5 reports**:
```
STATUS: complete
ISSUE: 105
PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/460
PROGRESS: Checkout frontend components complete with e2e tests
BLOCKERS: None
```

**Orchestrator checks state file**:
```yaml
issues_status:
  101: complete (Pod-1)
  102: complete (Pod-2)
  103: complete (Pod-3)
  104: complete (Pod-4)
  105: complete (Pod-5)
  
all_issues_complete: true
trigger_review_phase: true
```

## Merge Sequence

The orchestrator coordinates the merge sequence:

```bash
# 1. Merge foundation (no conflicts expected)
git checkout main
git merge feature/101-payment-gateway-abstraction

# 2. Merge providers (independent, can be parallel)
git merge feature/102-stripe-payment-provider
git merge feature/103-paypal-payment-provider

# 3. Merge API (may have minor conflicts)
git merge feature/104-checkout-api-endpoints
# Orchestrator handles any conflicts

# 4. Merge frontend (depends on API)
git merge feature/105-checkout-frontend
```

## Key Observations

### What Worked Well

1. **Dependency Management**: Clear dependencies prevented wasted work
2. **Parallel Execution**: 3 pods working simultaneously on providers and API
3. **Proactive Communication**: Breaking change alert prevented downstream issues
4. **Conflict Prevention**: Pod isolation avoided merge conflicts

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Shared Utilities**: Required coordination for common files
2. **API Contract Changes**: Ripple effects needed careful management
3. **Testing Coordination**: Integration tests needed all components

### Performance Metrics

```yaml
metrics:
  total_time_hours: 12
  sequential_estimate_hours: 68
  speedup_factor: 5.67
  
  pod_utilization:
    pod-1: 82%
    pod-2: 71%
    pod-3: 69%
    pod-4: 74%
    pod-5: 88%
    
  communication:
    total_messages: 347
    broadcast_messages: 12
    direct_messages: 89
    status_updates: 246
    
  conflicts:
    prevented: 2
    auto_resolved: 0
    manual_intervention: 0
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Issue Sizing Matters
- Issues should be 8-20 hours for optimal pod utilization
- Too small: overhead dominates
- Too large: reduces parallelization opportunities

### 2. Clear Interfaces Critical
- Well-defined interfaces in issue 101 enabled parallel work
- Breaking changes must be communicated immediately
- Contract-first development works well with MAWEP

### 3. File Locking Strategy
- Coarse-grained locking (whole file) is simpler and sufficient
- Most conflicts are predictable from issue descriptions
- Shared utilities should be minimized

### 4. Agent Specialization
- Agents could specialize (frontend vs backend)
- But generalist agents provide more flexibility
- Hybrid approach: preferred expertise with flexibility

## Failure Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Pod Non-Responsive
```bash
# Pod-3 stops responding at T+5 hours
[ERROR] Task tool invocation for Pod-3 timed out
[INFO] Orchestrator marks Pod-3 as non-responsive
[INFO] Issue 103 reassigned to Pod-1 (now idle after PR merge)
[WARN] 2 hour delay in issue 103 completion
```

### Scenario 2: Blocking Issue Delayed
```bash
# Issue 101 encounters unexpected complexity
[WARN] Issue 101 ETA extended by 4 hours
[INFO] Dependent issues 102,103,104 delayed
[INFO] Pods 2,3,4 idle - no other assignable work
[ERROR] Sprint deadline at risk
```

### Scenario 3: Merge Conflict
```bash
# Semantic conflict in API contracts
[ERROR] Auto-merge failed for feature/104-checkout-api-endpoints
[INFO] Escalating to human review
[WARN] Frontend development (105) blocked pending resolution
```

## Recommendations

1. **Issue Preparation**: Invest time in clear issue definitions
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Explicit is better than discovered
3. **Buffer Time**: Account for 20% coordination overhead
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time dashboard essential for oversight
5. **Escalation Path**: Clear process for human intervention

This scenario demonstrates MAWEP's ability to coordinate complex development tasks while handling real-world challenges through its fail-fast, explicit communication approach.
