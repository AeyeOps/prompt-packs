```

**Orchestrator Decision**: Assign issue 101 to Agent-0 since it has no dependencies.

### T+1 minute: First Assignment

```python
# Agent-0 receives assignment
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:01:00Z",
  "from": "orchestrator",
  "to": "direct:agent_0",
  "message_type": "issue_assignment",
  "payload": {
    "issue_number": 101,
    "branch": "feature/101-payment-gateway-abstraction",
    "worktree": "/repo/worktrees/agent-0-issue-101"
  }
}
```

**Agent-0 Actions**:
```bash
# Create worktree
git worktree add /repo/worktrees/agent-0-issue-101 -b feature/101-payment-gateway-abstraction

# Start implementation
cd /repo/worktrees/agent-0-issue-101
```

### T+30 minutes: Progress Update

**Agent-0** posts to GitHub issue #101:
```markdown

  "from_agent": "agent-0",
  "to": ["broadcast:breaking_changes"],
  "message_type": "interface_change",
  "payload": {
    "file": "src/payment/interfaces.py",
    "change_type": "new_required_field",
    "details": "Added 'idempotency_key' as required field in PaymentRequest",
    "affected_issues": ["102", "103", "104"],
    "migration_guide": "Generate UUID for idempotency_key in all PaymentRequest instantiations"
  },
  "priority": "high",
  "requires_ack": true
}
```

**Orchestrator** holds off on assigning issues 102, 103, 104 until this is resolved.

### T+4 hours: Issue 101 Complete

**Agent-0** completes issue 101:
```bash
# Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(payment): implement payment gateway abstraction (#101)

- Created abstract PaymentGateway base class
- Defined PaymentRequest/Response interfaces  
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Included transaction state management
- 95% test coverage achieved"

git push origin feature/101-payment-gateway-abstraction
```

**Orchestrator** immediately assigns:
- Issue 102 â†’ Agent-1
- Issue 103 â†’ Agent-2  
- Issue 104 â†’ Agent-3

### T+4.5 hours: Parallel Development

Three agents work simultaneously:

**Agent-1** (Stripe):
```python
# Working on src/payment/providers/stripe.py
class StripeGateway(PaymentGateway):
    def process_payment(self, request: PaymentRequest) -> PaymentResponse:
        # Implementation...
```

**Agent-2** (PayPal):
```python
# Working on src/payment/providers/paypal.py
class PayPalGateway(PaymentGateway):
    def process_payment(self, request: PaymentRequest) -> PaymentResponse:
        # Implementation...
```

**Agent-3** (API):
```python
# Working on src/api/checkout.py
@router.post("/checkout/process")
async def process_checkout(request: CheckoutRequest) -> CheckoutResponse:
    # Implementation...
```

### T+6 hours: Conflict Detection

**Agent-3** attempts to modify a shared utility file:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T16:00:00Z",
  "from_agent": "agent-3",
  "to": ["orchestrator"],
  "message_type": "file_conflict_check",
  "payload": {
    "files": ["src/utils/validation.py"],
    "action": "modify"
  }
}
```

**Orchestrator** responds:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T16:00:10Z",
  "from": "orchestrator",
  "to": ["direct:agent_3"],
  "message_type": "conflict_detected",
  "payload": {
    "file": "src/utils/validation.py",
    "locked_by": "agent-1",
    "suggestion": "Create new validation in src/api/validators.py instead"
  }
}
```

### T+8 hours: Dependencies Resolved

**Agent-1** completes issue 102:
```bash
git push origin feature/102-stripe-payment-provider
```

**Agent-2** completes issue 103:
```bash
git push origin feature/103-paypal-payment-provider
```

**Agent-3** completes issue 104:
```bash
git push origin feature/104-checkout-api-endpoints
```

**Orchestrator** assigns issue 105 â†’ Agent-4

### T+10 hours: Frontend Development

**Agent-4** starts frontend work with all dependencies ready:
```typescript
// frontend/components/Checkout.tsx
import { useCheckoutAPI } from '../api/checkout';

export const Checkout: React.FC = () => {
  // Implementation with full API available
};
```

### T+12 hours: Final Coordination

**Agent-4** broadcasts completion readiness:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T22:00:00Z",
  "from_agent": "agent-4",
  "to": ["broadcast:merge_ready"],
  "message_type": "feature_complete",
  "payload": {
    "issue": 105,
    "branch": "feature/105-checkout-frontend",
    "integration_tests": "passing",
    "ready_for_review": true
  }
}
```

## Merge Sequence

The orchestrator coordinates the merge sequence:

```bash
# 1. Merge foundation (no conflicts expected)
git checkout main
git merge feature/101-payment-gateway-abstraction

# 2. Merge providers (independent, can be parallel)
git merge feature/102-stripe-payment-provider
git merge feature/103-paypal-payment-provider

# 3. Merge API (may have minor conflicts)
git merge feature/104-checkout-api-endpoints
# Orchestrator handles any conflicts

# 4. Merge frontend (depends on API)
git merge feature/105-checkout-frontend
```

```

## Key Observations

### What Worked Well

1. **Dependency Management**: Clear dependencies prevented wasted work
2. **Parallel Execution**: 3 agents working simultaneously on providers and API
3. **Proactive Communication**: Breaking change alert prevented downstream issues
4. **Conflict Prevention**: File locking avoided merge conflicts

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Shared Utilities**: Required coordination for common files
2. **API Contract Changes**: Ripple effects needed careful management
3. **Testing Coordination**: Integration tests needed all components

### Performance Metrics

```yaml
metrics:
  total_time_hours: 12
  sequential_estimate_hours: 68
  speedup_factor: 5.67
  
  agent_utilization:
    agent_0: 82%
    agent_1: 71%
    agent_2: 69%
    agent_3: 74%
    agent_4: 88%
    
  communication:
    total_messages: 347
    broadcast_messages: 12
    direct_messages: 89
    status_updates: 246
    
  conflicts:
    prevented: 2
    auto_resolved: 0
    manual_intervention: 0
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Issue Sizing Matters
- Issues should be 8-20 hours for optimal agent utilization
- Too small: overhead dominates
- Too large: reduces parallelization opportunities

### 2. Clear Interfaces Critical
- Well-defined interfaces in issue 101 enabled parallel work
- Breaking changes must be communicated immediately
- Contract-first development works well with MAWEP

### 3. File Locking Strategy
- Coarse-grained locking (whole file) is simpler and sufficient
- Most conflicts are predictable from issue descriptions
- Shared utilities should be minimized

### 4. Agent Specialization
- Agents could specialize (frontend vs backend)
- But generalist agents provide more flexibility
- Hybrid approach: preferred expertise with flexibility

## Failure Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Agent Crash
```bash
# Agent-2 crashes at T+5 hours
[ERROR] Agent-2 health check failed
[INFO] Orchestrator detecting agent failure
[INFO] Issue 103 reassigned to Agent-0 (now free)
[WARN] 2 hour delay in issue 103 completion
```

### Scenario 2: Blocking Issue Delayed
```bash
# Issue 101 encounters unexpected complexity
[WARN] Issue 101 ETA extended by 4 hours
[INFO] Dependent issues 102,103,104 delayed
[INFO] Agents 1,2,3 idle - no other assignable work
[ERROR] Sprint deadline at risk
```

### Scenario 3: Merge Conflict
```bash
# Semantic conflict in API contracts
[ERROR] Auto-merge failed for feature/104-checkout-api-endpoints
[INFO] Escalating to human review
[WARN] Frontend development (105) blocked pending resolution
```

## Recommendations

1. **Issue Preparation**: Invest time in clear issue definitions
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Explicit is better than discovered
3. **Buffer Time**: Account for 20% coordination overhead
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time dashboard essential for oversight
5. **Escalation Path**: Clear process for human intervention

This scenario demonstrates MAWEP's ability to coordinate complex development tasks while handling real-world challenges through its fail-fast, explicit communication approach.
