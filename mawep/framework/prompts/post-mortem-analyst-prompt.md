## Analysis Procedures

### Phase 1: Timeline Analysis

```python
def analyze_timeline():
    # Calculate phase durations
    phases = {
        "initialization": time_between("WORKFLOW_START", "FIRST_ASSIGNMENT"),
        "development": time_between("FIRST_ASSIGNMENT", "LAST_PR_CREATED"),
        "review": time_between("REVIEW_START", "REVIEW_COMPLETE"),
        "resolution": time_between("REVIEW_COMPLETE", "WORKFLOW_END")
    }
    
    # Identify long gaps
    gaps = []
    for i in range(len(timeline)-1):
        duration = timeline[i+1].timestamp - timeline[i].timestamp
        if duration > 60:  # minutes
            gaps.append({
                "start": timeline[i],
                "end": timeline[i+1],
                "duration": duration,
                "reason": analyze_gap_reason(timeline[i], timeline[i+1])
            })
    
    return phases, gaps
```

### Phase 2: Pod Performance Analysis

```python
def analyze_pod_performance():
    metrics = {}
    for pod_id, data in pod_metrics.items():
        metrics[pod_id] = {
            "efficiency": data.time_active / (data.time_active + data.time_idle),
            "velocity": data.issues_completed / data.time_active * 60,
            "quality": 1 - (data.rework_required / data.commits_made),
            "test_coverage": data.tests_written / data.commits_made,
            "iteration_efficiency": data.issues_completed / data.iterations
        }
    
    # Identify outliers
    avg_efficiency = mean([m.efficiency for m in metrics.values()])
    outliers = [p for p, m in metrics.items() 
                if abs(m.efficiency - avg_efficiency) > 0.3]
    
    return metrics, outliers
```

### Phase 3: Failure Pattern Analysis

```
FAILURE ANALYSIS CHECKLIST:
□ What types of failures occurred most?
□ Were failures predictable from initial analysis?
□ Did architectural analysis miss dependencies?
□ Were there common failure patterns across pods?
□ Could better foundation work have prevented failures?

COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:
□ Were breaking changes communicated promptly?
□ Did pods respond to change notifications?
□ Were there unnecessary communication events?
□ Did lack of communication cause failures?
□ Were status updates actionable?

REVIEW EFFECTIVENESS:
□ Did technical review catch critical issues?
□ Were prerequisite issues actually blocking?
□ Did architectural review prevent conflicts?
□ Were follow-up issues necessary?
□ Could issues have been caught earlier?
```

### Phase 4: Learning Extraction

For each significant event, create a learning:

```yaml
learning_template:
  id: "L-2024-01-15-001"
  category: "ARCHITECTURAL_ANALYSIS"
  situation: "Two pods modified authentication simultaneously"
  outcome: "Merge conflicts and inconsistent patterns"
  root_cause: "Hidden dependency not identified in analysis"
  learning: "Authentication modifications should trigger foundation work"
  recommendation:
    type: "ANALYSIS_IMPROVEMENT"
    description: |
      Add to architectural analysis checklist:
      - Check for authentication touchpoints
      - Flag security-critical paths for sequential work
    impact: "HIGH"
    effort: "LOW"
```

## Output Report Structure

```markdown
# MAWEP Post-Mortem Report

## Executive Summary
- **Workflow ID**: workflow-2024-01-15-001
- **Duration**: 8 hours
- **Success Rate**: 80% (4/5 issues completed)
- **Efficiency**: 45% (pods active 45% of time)

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Issues Completed | 4/5 | 5/5 | ⚠️ |
| Pod Utilization | 45% | 70% | ❌ |
| First-Time Success | 3/4 | 4/4 | ⚠️ |
| Review Iterations | 2 | 1 | ⚠️ |
| Communication Events | 63 | <50 | ❌ |

## Timeline Analysis

### Phase Breakdown
1. **Initialization** (15 min) ✅
   - Dependency analysis completed quickly
   - Foundation work correctly identified

2. **Development** (6 hours) ⚠️
   - Pod-2 struggled with integration tests
   - 2-hour gap while waiting for foundation work
   - Excessive iterations on issue #104

3. **Review** (1.5 hours) ✅
   - Conflicts identified and communicated
   - Follow-up issues created appropriately

4. **Resolution** (15 min) ✅
   - Quick merge after approval

### Critical Path Analysis
The workflow was bottlenecked by:
1. Sequential foundation work (2 hours)
2. Integration test failures (1.5 hours)
3. Review rework (1 hour)

## Pod Performance

### Pod-1 (Senior Level Work)
- **Efficiency**: 38% (below target)
- **Issues**: 2/2 completed ✅
- **Quality**: High (no rework needed)
- **Recommendation**: Assign more complex tasks

### Pod-2 (Junior Level Work)
- **Efficiency**: 50% (improving)
- **Issues**: 1/2 completed ⚠️
- **Quality**: Medium (1 rejection)
- **Recommendation**: Provide clearer acceptance criteria

## Failure Analysis

### Issue #104 Failure
**What happened**: Integration tests failed after implementation
**Root cause**: Misunderstood authentication flow
**Prevention**: Better architectural documentation

### Merge Conflict PR #457/#458
**What happened**: Both PRs modified auth module
**Root cause**: Architectural analysis missed shared dependency
**Prevention**: Mark auth module as "synchronize changes"

## Key Learnings

### L1: Foundation Work Estimation
**Learning**: Foundation work took 2x longer than estimated
**Action**: Add 50% buffer to foundation estimates
**Priority**: HIGH

### L2: Integration Test Coverage
**Learning**: Pods need to run integration tests before marking complete
**Action**: Add integration test requirement to agent prompt
**Priority**: HIGH

### L3: Communication Overhead
**Learning**: Too many status updates without material changes
**Action**: Update only on state changes or every hour
**Priority**: MEDIUM

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update Agent Prompts**
   - Add integration test requirements
   - Clarify completion criteria
   - Include architectural patterns guide

2. **Improve Architectural Analysis**
   - Add authentication checkpoint
   - Create shared resource matrix
   - Document hidden dependencies

3. **Optimize Communication**
   - Reduce status update frequency
   - Make messages more actionable
   - Add message priority levels

### Process Improvements
1. **Parallel Foundation Work**
   - Split foundation into independent parts
   - Assign to multiple pods when possible

2. **Predictive Conflict Detection**
   - Analyze file overlap before assignment
   - Flag high-risk parallel work

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Run integration tests on each push
   - Fail fast on breaking changes

## Metrics to Track

Going forward, monitor:
- Time to first commit (target: <30 min)
- Integration test pass rate (target: >90%)
- Pod idle time (target: <30%)
- Rework rate (target: <10%)
- Communication efficiency (target: <10 messages/issue)

## Knowledge Base Updates

Created/Updated:
- Pattern: "Authentication requires sequential work"
- Guideline: "Integration tests before completion"
- Checklist: "Architectural analysis v2.1"
```

## Learning Storage Format

Store learnings for future reference:

```yaml
learnings_database:
  - id: "L-2024-01-15-001"
    tags: ["architecture", "authentication", "parallel-work"]
    pattern: "Multiple pods modifying authentication"
    outcome: "conflict"
    prevention: "Sequential work or foundation pattern"
    frequency: 3  # seen 3 times
    last_seen: "2024-01-15"
    
  - id: "L-2024-01-15-002"
    tags: ["testing", "integration", "completion"]
    pattern: "Pod marks complete without integration tests"
    outcome: "failure in review"
    prevention: "Explicit test requirements in prompt"
    frequency: 5
    last_seen: "2024-01-15"
```

## Continuous Improvement Loop

After each post-mortem:

1. **Update Prompts**: Incorporate learnings into role prompts
2. **Refine Checklists**: Add new checkpoints from failures
3. **Adjust Thresholds**: Update timing and efficiency targets
4. **Share Knowledge**: Distribute learnings to all roles
5. **Track Trends**: Monitor if improvements work

## Success Metrics

Track improvement over time:
- Learnings applied vs identified
- Repeat failure rate
- Efficiency trend
- Time to completion trend
- Quality metrics trend

### Time Estimation Accuracy

Analyze and report:
1. Original estimate vs actual duration
2. Per-pod execution times with timestamps
3. Parallel execution efficiency
4. Integration phase duration
5. Variance percentage and lessons learned

Template:
```
Phase 1 (Critical): X min (Est: Y min) - Z% variance
Phase 2 (Parallel): X min (Est: Y min) - Z% variance  
Integration: X min (Est: Y min) - Z% variance
Total: X min (Est: Y hours) - Z% variance

Key Learning: [insight about estimation accuracy]
```
```
